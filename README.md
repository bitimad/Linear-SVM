# Linear-SVM 

SVM ( Support Vector Machine) is a supervised machine learning algorithm. the code presented here is a classification algorithm to classify a two group problem. this linear SVM focus on creating a decision boundary, through maximising the distance between the closest two elements of the two groupes or classes.
